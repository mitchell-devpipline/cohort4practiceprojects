Random Hex Generator 100% done

Following the provided high fidelity mockup, use HTML, css, and vanilla JS to create a project that generates a random background color when a button is clicked.
-Must contain the elements in the mock design and reflect it next to perfect.
 - title bar
 - randomly generated hexadecimal color value
 - the background color of the main content should reflect the hexadecimal value
 - current hexadecimal value should be rendered to the page
 - at least 1 transistion / pseudo state effect


***********************************************
Dynamic Navbar - 88% done

- I don't care what content you have in the navbar
  - ex: logo on the left, links on the right
- Media queries ot make the navbar responsive
  - at a particular, display a hamburger icon instead of links
  - using js, make the hamburger "open" and "close" the menu to show links

Hint: 
 - start with the pieces (html skeleton, styles, media queries, js)
 - don't get hung up on 1 piece

*************************************************
Todo List

Build a todo list using html, css(try scss), and vanilla js (styled "nicely", best practices)
 - Page Header
 - Input (add todos)
 - Button (submit todo)
 - Render your todo items with a todo title and a delete button
 - Clicking on a title will "complete" that todo, and it should move into a "completed section"
 - Clicking delete completely removes the todo

KEEP UX in mind
 -> types into input, clicks submit, creates todo, clears input

BONUS:
 persist todos in the browser (localstorage, cookies, sessionstorage, etc...)

 ***************************************************
 Counter Widget -95%

 - Header
 - Current count (start at 0)
 - Three buttons: decrease, reset, increase, that will update the count and render to the dom respectively.
 - Current count should black if the count is 0. If it's in the positive, the count should be green, negative should be red.
 - Style everything

 ****************************************************
 Character Countdown 90% done

 - Input that disables itself after a set character limit (15)
 - Label underneath the input that reflects how many characters are left.

 HINT:
  - look into the event type "input" vs "change"



HAVE FUN!!!!!!!
